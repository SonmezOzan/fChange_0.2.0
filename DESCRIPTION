Title: Change Point Analysis in Functional Data
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Ozan Sonmez, Alexander Aue, Gregory Rice
Maintainer: Ozan Sonmez <osonmez@ucdavis.edu>
Description: Change point estimation and detection methods for functional data are implemented using dimension reduction via functional principal component analysis and a fully-functional (norm-based) method. Detecting and dating structural breaks for both dependent and independent functional samples is illustrated along with some basic functional data generating processes.
